# Abstract

We will be trying to determine what the best neighborhood is for children to grow up in. The metrics we will be using are education or high school graduation rate, the number of playgrounds, and public safety concerns.  
The data sets we have analyzed have shown the Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh for a child to grow up in. This is supported by all three data sets especialy public safety/crime data set and the playground data set. Squirrel Hill South is leading as one of the safest neighborhoods in Pittsburgh because it is ranked number eight in neighborhoods with the least safety incidents. Additionally, Squirel Hill South has the greatest number of playgrounds out of all the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. Squirel Hill South is also leading in education as it is significantly above average in high school
